# Hello! Welcome to PRG1 - Introduction to programming. I will guide you through these early steps.
#
# What are we learning?
# =====================
#
# We're going to learn the fundamentals of the programming language Python. Most
# programming languages are quite similar, so it doesn't matter much that this
# is Python. The key ideas are the same.
#
# We're going to learn enough to succeed in the Makers interview process. The
# ideas themselves are quite simple. The complexity of programming is in the
# combination of these ideas. Here's a list of what we'll learn:
#
# * Functions (making your own programs)
# * Arithmetic (basic maths)
# * Expressions and statements (the building blocks of programs)
# * Strings (letters and words)
# * Conditionals (ifs and elses)
# * Lists (sequences of items)
# * Loops (whiles and fors)
# * Dictionaries (pairs of items)
#
# You will find exercises throughout the material, signposted with @TASK. We
# will finish the material with some extra tricky exercises for you to test your
# skills.
#
# By the way — these lines starting with the `#` character? They're called
# comments. They don't get run by Python — they're just for me to talk to you.
# You can create one yourself if you like.

# Now open up 011_identity.py and get started with some real code!
