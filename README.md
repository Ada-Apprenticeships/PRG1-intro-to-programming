# PRG1 Module Introduction

Welcome to PRG1, the Introduction to Programming module—your second module in your apprenticeship. This module develops your computational thinking and problem-solving skills, which will benefit your future career regardless of whether you continue on the software engineering pathway or one of the others.

## The Role of AI in Programming

Generative AI has dominated headlines recently, with predictions that it will replace jobs and handle problem-solving tasks for us. Whilst AI can assist with trivial programming tasks, it has significant limitations: it makes mistakes and sometimes provides outdated or contextually inappropriate solutions.

More concerning is the risk that over-reliance on generative AI reduces our need to think critically, potentially stunting our cognitive abilities. If we blindly trust AI outputs without developing our own analytical skills, this dependency could have serious negative consequences for our future problem-solving capabilities.

## Why Core Skills Matter

The skills you'll develop in this module are invaluable because you'll learn to:
- Break problems down logically
- Recognise correct versus incorrect solutions
- Identify when AI outputs are flawed or outdated

Without these foundational skills, you'll never know whether an AI's suggestions are correct. Experienced developers who've built these competencies over many years can easily spot when generative AI tools miss the mark or lack proper context.

## Our Approach to AI Tools

While AI developers are aggressively marketing their tools to help existing developers work faster and smarter, both we and your employers agree that mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking, problem-solving, and decomposition is essential for your long-term success.

**Therefore, AI tools are not permitted in PRG1.** This restriction prevents these tools from stunting your development of crucial core skills.

Don't worry—we'll incorporate generative AI tools in future modules, as they're an inevitable part of the industry. However, for this foundational module, developing these essential skills yourself is our priority.



## How do I get started?

To get started, if you haven't already done so:

1. Firstly you need to create yourself a GitHub account using your **Ada email address** and log in to GitHub.
2. Next, from the green 'Use this template' button on the right, click and
   choose 'Open in a codespace' from the drop-down menu. This will open up the
   programming interface you will use to learn.

show the Open in a codespace option.](images/open-in-codespace.png)

3. After this, keep reading down the file for further instructions.

⚙️ **If you prefer to use your own local development setup**

If you're confident using your own local development setup and you have Python 3
installed, you can instead clone this repository and work through it that way.
However only do this if you are sure you know what you're doing.

## How do I use GitHub Codespaces?

Once you have opened your new codespace, you will see an interface which we will
call the IDE. It should look like this (although may have a different colour):

![A screenshot of the interface with the files on the left, the code in the middle, and the terminal at the bottom.](images/codespace-interface.png)

You will need to engage with three parts of it:

* The file panel on your left, working through the numbered files of code in order.
* The code panel (if you're in your codespace, that's this one you're reading
  this text from) where you'll read and write code.
* The terminal panel at the bottom, where you'll run code.

If you find the default appearance hard to read, you can switch to a different
colour theme within the IDE.

1. From the cog icon labelled 'Manage' at the bottom left of the IDE, click
   Settings.
2. Under 'Workbench' > 'Apperance', scroll down to find 'Color Theme' and choose
   a different one from the provided list. I would recommend one of these:

* GitHub Light Default
* GitHub Dark Dimmed
* GitHub Dark Default

You can close the Settings tab once you've changed your theme - click the 'X' on
the tab to close it or other files, like you'd close tabs on a browser.

## How to read the material

The learning materials are files of code. They look a bit like this:

```python
def just_return_it(num):
  return num

# This is a function. A function is a reusable block of code.
```

The first two lines are code. This is what you will be learning how to create.

That last line starting with a `#` is a comment. We will talk you through the
ideas behind the code using comments.

You should work through each file sequentially, starting with `010_comments.py`.
You should work through each file top to bottom.

At the end of the material there are four optional files. You don't need to
complete these to be ready for the assessment, but they might help.


## GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is owned and managed by GitHub, not Ada - we have just
chosen to use their platform as GitHub is an industry standard. 
There are a generous free number of hours of usage
per month, and the 60 hours of free usage you would get on more than enough to complete it. 
You absolutely do not need to pay for more usage to complete the PRG1 module,
although of course if you want to use Github Codespaces for other things apart
from this, that is up to you.

For the assigment tasks, you will be using **our** Codespaces credits, so don't worry about that.

## I have some feedback about the material

We would receive it with gratitude. [You can give us feedback
