# Hello! Welcome to PRG1 - Introduction to programming. 
# 
# What are we learning?
# =====================
#
# We're going to learn the fundamentals of the programming language Python. Most
# programming languages are quite similar, so it doesn't matter much that this
# is Python. The key ideas are the same.
#
# We're going to learn enough to succeed in the PRG1 module. The
# ideas themselves are quite simple. The complexity of programming is in the
# combination of these ideas. Here's a list of what we'll learn:
#
# * Functions (making your own programs)
# * Arithmetic (basic maths)
# * Expressions and statements (the building blocks of programs)
# * Conditionals (ifs and elses)
# * Strings (letters and words)
# * Lists (sequences of items)
# * Loops (whiles and fors)
# * File Reading and Writing
# * Dictionaries (pairs of items)
# * Regular Expressions (pattern matching)
# * Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
# * 2D Lists (more dequences of items)
#
# You will find exercises throughout the material, signposted with @TASK. We
# will finish the material with some extra tricky exercises for you to test your
# skills.
#
# By the way — these lines starting with the `#` character? They're called
# comments. They don't get run by Python — in this case they're just for me to talk 
# to you.

# You can create one yourself if you like.

# Comments serve several important purposes in code:
# 1. To explain what the code does and how it works
# 2. To document assumptions and requirements
# 3. To temporarily disable code during debugging
# 4. To provide context and guidance for other developers
# 5. To break up code into logical sections
# 
# Comments start with # in Python and are ignored by the interpreter
# They can be placed on their own line or at the end of a code line

# Now open up 002_functions.py and get started with some real code!
